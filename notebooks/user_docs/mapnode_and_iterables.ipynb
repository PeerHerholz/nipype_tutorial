Some nodes accept multiple files and do exactly the same thing on them, but some don't (they expect only one file). MapNode can solve this problem. Imagine you have the following workflow:\n",

This special version of node will (under the bonnet) create an instance of ``B`` for every item in the list from the input. The compulsory argument ``iterfield`` defines which input should it iterate over (for example in single file smooth interface you would like to iterate over input files not the smoothing width). At the end outputs are collected into a list again. In other words this is map and reduce scenario.\n",

Even though a bit confusing this is true. You can specify more than one input to iterate over but the lists that you provide (for all the inputs specified in iterfield) have to have the same length. MapNode will then pair the parameters up and run the first instance with first set of parameters and second with second set of parameters. For example, this code:"
