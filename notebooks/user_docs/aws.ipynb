    "\n",
    "The DataSink class now supports sending output data directly to an AWS S3 bucket. It does this through the introduction of several input attributes to the DataSink interface and by parsing the `base_directory` attribute. This class uses the [boto3](https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [botocore](https://botocore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) Python packages to interact with AWS. To configure the DataSink to write data to S3, the user must set the ``base_directory`` property to an S3-style filepath.\n",

The DataSink treats the S3 base directory exactly as it would a local directory, maintaining support for containers, substitutions, subfolders, \".\" notation, etc to route output data appropriately.\n",

    "``bucket`` is a boto3 Bucket object that the user can use to overwrite the bucket specified in their ``base_directory``. This can be useful if one has to manually create a bucket instance on their own using special credentials (or using a mock server like [fakes3](https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3>). This is typically used for developers unit-testing the DataSink class. Most users do not need to use this attribute for actual workflows. This is an optional argument.\n",
